        I've been writing computer programs for over 10 years now, my first
        language was Pascal, but throughout school and university I explored
        many different paradigms from Java to Prolog to Assembly.

        I cut my teeth at IBM where I learnt from some fantastic engineers,
        since then I have worked as a consultant for startups of various sizes
        helping them build their products, and scale their teams.

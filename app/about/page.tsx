        I'm a software engineer from Ireland who likes to travel quite a bit -
        I'm currently taking a bit of a break from paid work to build some
        personal projects and travel around Europe in my van üöê. But I'm always
        open to new opportunities, so feel free to reach out!

        My "professional" experience is in web development, I have been working
        in-depth with <AboutLink href="https://reactjs.org/">React</AboutLink>{" "}
        frontends and <AboutLink href="https://nodejs.org/en">Node</AboutLink>{" "}
        backends for the past 6-7 years. Working with a variety of Database
        technologies, MongoDB, Postgres, Redis, DynamoDB, etc.

        I recently founded a small startup called{" "}

        ü¶Ä though. For years I have been trying to find a way to use it in my
        day-to-day work, but it's not always possible. So that's why I am taking
        some time off to work on Omni. A WASM based IDL for generating
        Client/Server code written in Rust. It will be 99% a learning experience
        for me, but I will be posting about my journey on this blog.

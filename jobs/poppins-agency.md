As a Frontend Contractor at Poppins Agency, I crafted two visually striking marketing sites from scratch over three months. These sites featured intricate Figma designs and utilized CSS animations extensively.

My role encompassed setting up the Storyblok CMS and designing a monorepo of libraries to accelerate future app development. Noteworthy is my proposal to the core Storyblok team for an SDK aimed at expediting CMS configuration for developers.

Key technologies I employed include Next.js for dynamic web functionality, TailwindCSS for efficient styling, and TypeScript for code robustness. This setup facilitated smooth content management and site maintenance.

Throughout this engagement, I showcased an ability to deliver complex design concepts and optimize development workflows for lasting efficiency.

During my tenure at TerraQuest, I was an integral member of the frontend team responsible for creating a land referencing portal for the Northern Irish government. This initiative was part of a broader project spanning the entirety of the UK.

Recognizing the importance of **SEO for public-facing websites**, I proposed a strategic overhaul by transitioning the existing GatsbyJS frontend to Next.js (they had a lot of dynamic content that would be painful to deliver statically). To advocate for this transition, I spearheaded the development of multiple Next.js prototypes, effectively showcasing the advantages to stakeholders.

Additionally, I played a pivotal _role in enhancing the organization's component library._ This involved contributing complex components such as a headless Data Table and a Date Picker, both of which significantly enriched the library's capabilities.

At FundamentalVR I was part of a team of 3 developers in charge of delivering a Electron (React) application to replace a legacy Unity application.

We had ownership of our serverless REST API along with several supporting services. We worked under intense time pressure and managed to deliver a high quality product in 3 months, complete with a comphrensive test suite and a reliable and available REST API.

Utilising async event systems wherever possible to reduce load on key webhooks and services.
